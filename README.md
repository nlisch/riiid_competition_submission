# riiid_competition_submission

Python Version : 3.7

Python/notebooks script to predict answer to the next question to solve riiid Kaggle competition.

Data is provided in the competition ( ~ 100 Millions of rows ). Code needs to be executable on 8 CPUs.

This repo aims to show research code to build, clean, process and build model to predict the final answer of each user. The code is not optimised for production pipeline, even some functions are created to facilitate time run code processing.



## Structure:
	1. Data cleaning & Features processing
	2. Build model & evaluate perf
	3. Kaggle notebook to predict on new data using a state
